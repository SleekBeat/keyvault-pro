## Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load

**Problem**: Error message when loading the extension

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you selected the correct folder (should contain `manifest.json`)
2. Check that all files are properly extracted (not corrupted)
3. Try restarting your browser and loading again
4. Check browser console for specific error messages

### Extension Icon Not Showing

**Solutions**:
1. Click the puzzle piece icon (extensions menu)
2. Look for "KeyVault Pro" in the list
3. Click the pin/eye icon to make it visible
4. Refresh the extensions page and check if it's enabled

### "Developer Mode" Option Missing
